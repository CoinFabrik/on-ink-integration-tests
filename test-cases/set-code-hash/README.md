## Description

This test is intended to showcase the functionality (in a vulnerable setup) of the `set_code_hash` function, which allows changes to the contract logic or behaviour after deployment.

## Related ink! functions

- `set_code_hash`

## Test case

Both test cases implement the contract logic and attempt to use the `set_code_hash` functions.

## Comparison Integration vs E2E

The contract did not work on the integration test, but it did on the end-to-end test.

## Result

- Can it be implemented?
- How long will it take?
- Ideas for implementation
- Other notes
